Let me boil the debate down to the essentials, pick a side, and lay out an actionable game-plan.

Key Bull Points
• Travel recovery tail-wind. Post-pandemic demand for leisure travel and “live-anywhere” work travel is still expanding and Airbnb is structurally tied to that secular trend.  
• Brand moat & asset-light model. Airbnb remains the go-to platform for unique stays; no cap-ex burden like hotels, so incremental bookings drop heavily to the bottom line.  
• Expansion levers. Long-term stays, Experiences, corporate travel and AI-driven search/personalisation enlarge TAM.  
• Technicals not stretched. Price is above the 50-day SMA, RSI is mid-50s (not overbought) and the stock has risen 3 % in a weak tape. Valuation at ~20× forward EPS is not demanding for a 15-20 % topline CAGR story.  
• Social-media traction (9 % ↑ Facebook, 20 % ↑ Twitter mentions) hints at resilient consumer mind-share.

Key Bear Points
• Macro malaise. IMF cuts world-growth forecast to 2.34 %; new U.S. tariffs could dent discretionary travel budgets.  
• Early softness in some U.S. markets (Denver, Austin, Phoenix) flagged by Seeking Alpha; sell-side (Cantor, Truist) trimmed guidance.  
• Competitive encroachment from hotels and other rental platforms.  
• Insider selling and a still-rich 10.5× sales multiple raise governance/valuation doubts.

Weighing the Arguments
The bears raise legitimate macro and competitive concerns, but most of their points are either indirect (tariffs on Brazilian steel don’t determine whether Europeans book Spanish villas) or already visible in consensus numbers.  By contrast, bulls provide direct, company-specific drivers—brand dominance, new product lanes, a reasonable multiple for a platform with 30 %+ EBITDA margins—plus tangible leading indicators (technical strength, engagement uptick).  A 20× forward P/E for an asset-light, cash-generative platform is hardly a bubble price.

Verdict: BUY

Rationale
1. Secular, not cyclical, growth engine. Flexible work + preference for unique accommodations keeps bookings rising even if GDP growth slows.  
2. Attractive risk/reward. The stock has already corrected this year; at ~20× earnings you’re buying a category leader at a multiple in line with the S&P 500 but with far superior growth and margins.  
3. Macro “offsets.” A weaker dollar actually helps inbound travel to the U.S.—one of Airbnb’s largest markets—and tariffs on goods do little to dampen experience-based spending.  
4. Downside cushioning. $7 B cash, negligible debt, and positive FCF give management room to buy back shares or invest through a slump.

Investment Plan

Position sizing & entry
• Target position: 4 % of equity portfolio.  
• Phase-in: Buy one-third now (market order). Buy second third on any pullback to the 200-day SMA (~$125). Final third after the upcoming earnings print if guidance confirms re-acceleration. This staged approach manages headline risk.

Risk management
• Hard stop: Close half the position if price closes below $110 (≈15 % downside from current levels), signaling a breakdown below multi-month support.  
• Hedge: Buy 3-month 110-strike puts equivalent to 50 % of share count for cheap tail-risk protection.  

Catalyst watch
1. Q3 booking trends and commentary on Experiences/long-term stays.  
2. Margin trajectory—look for >35 % adjusted EBITDA margins to support the multiple.  
3. Regulatory headlines (short-term-rental caps) in key metros; tighten position if multiple cities enact severe restrictions.

Upside target & exit
• Base-case 18 months: 25× forward EPS on $7.00 EPS ≈ $175 (35-40 % upside).  
• Trim 20 % of shares at $165, another 20 % at $180; let the rest run with a trailing stop at 15 % below peak.

Ongoing discipline (learning from past mistakes)
• Don’t let enthusiasm override macro red-flags—re-underwrite the thesis each quarter; if 2026 consensus growth drops below 12 %, reevaluate.  
• Monitor insider activity: a second wave of C-suite selling >$50 M would trigger a thesis check.  
• Balance qualitative buzz (social media, brand love) with hard data (nights booked, revenue per night) to avoid past error of overweighting sentiment.

Bottom line
Airbnb’s combination of secular growth, improving operating leverage and a now-reasonable valuation outweighs the macro noise raised by the bears. Initiate a well-sized, risk-managed BUY.
