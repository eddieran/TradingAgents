**A. Robotaxi Unveiling Announcement**
On August 6, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would unveil its long-anticipated Robotaxi on August 8.

- However, the mood shifted sharply on August 7 when TSLA shares dropped nearly 7% after Musk disclosed ambitions to establish a new political party, which raised concerns among investors about his shifting focus away from Tesla. The market reacted critically, as it’s speculated that such political endeavors might distract him from leading the company effectively.

This grassroots movement is aimed at holding Tesla accountable, and it continues to influence investor sentiment, prompting mixed discussions online.

**E. Stock Forecasts and Technical Analysis**
