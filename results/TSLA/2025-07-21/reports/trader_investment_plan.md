Based on the comprehensive analysis provided and considering both the bullish and bearish perspectives, my recommendation is to follow through on the proposed investment plan. The bearish points, particularly around valuation risk, operating headwinds, and macro pressures, are compelling reasons to reduce exposure to Tesla (TSLA) at this time.

Hereâ€™s a recap of the rationale for the recommendation to sell:

- **Valuation Risk**: TSLA's P/E ratio exceeding 75 is unsustainable, especially with expectations of a 23% decline in consensus EPS this quarter. Overvaluation can lead to significant downside if earnings do not meet high expectations.
  
- **Competitive Pressure**: The EV market is becoming more saturated with traditional automakers entering the space and offering competitive pricing, which could impact Tesla's market share and revenue growth.

- **Operational Challenges**: The company is facing quantifiable negative impacts from tariffs, raw material costs, and supply chain issues, which are likely to impact earnings in the near term.

- **Market Sentiment & Precedent**: The historical context of stocks experiencing significant downturns after failing to meet optimistic growth projections reinforces the need to take a proactive approach to reduce exposure now.

Given these factors, the strategic actions outlined, such as scaling down the position and utilizing limit orders, will allow for a disciplined exit and help safeguard capital.

Therefore, my firm decision is to **sell**.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
