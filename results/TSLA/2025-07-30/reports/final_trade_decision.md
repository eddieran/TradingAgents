RECOMMENDATION:  SELL  (Trim aggressively and hedge; stay nimble for a later re-entry)  

————————————————————————————————  
1.  Key Points From Each Analyst  
• Risky (Bull) – “Tesla’s TAM is exploding; forward P/E ~29 shows the market already expects earnings to re-accelerate.  Cash and Samsung AI partnership reinforce the edge.”  
• Safe (Bear) – “Three straight quarters of falling earnings, margin compression, and a 60-plus trailing P/E leave no cushion.  BYD and legacy OEMs are eating into price leadership.”  
• Neutral – “High valuations can persist, but trimming and using stops balances upside with protection.”  

2.  Why the Bear/Trim Case Wins  
• Facts trump optionality: EPS is down 16 % YoY while the multiple is still >60× – a classic set-up for multiple compression.  
• Competitive pressure is not theoretical; BYD outsold Tesla last quarter and is still cutting prices.  
• Macro headwinds (higher rates, tariff risk) cap near-term demand, yet the share price already bakes in flawless execution on Robotaxi/FSD.  
• History lesson: my prior losses came from “visionary” stories whose re-rating happened before the earnings arrived.  I will not repeat that error.  

3.  Revised Trade & Risk-Management Plan  
(Begins with the trader’s original outline, tweaked with Neutral’s “partial exposure” idea and Risky’s reminder to keep upside optionality.)  

A. Position Sizing  
• Sell 60 % of current shares at market (vs. 75 % originally).  
• Keep 25 % as a “core” position.  
• The remaining 15 % is converted into a synthetic stock replacement: sell January $350 calls and buy January $290 calls (low-delta call spread) – caps upside but frees cash and limits downside.  

B. Protective Hedge  
• Buy 6–9-month $280 puts on 50 % of the residual delta (strikes nudged down from $300 to reflect current support level highlighted by Neutral).  
• Funding: use part of the covered-call premium in the synthetic replacement to pay for the puts.  

C. Exit & Re-entry Triggers  
Exit the core if:  
1) Automotive gross margin <17 % OR  
2) Price closes below $250 for two consecutive weeks.  

Re-enter only if BOTH occur:  
• Forward P/E ≤35 × AND  
• Gross margin stabilises ≥20 %.  
Optional early re-entry if Robotaxi revenue becomes GAAP-recognised and >5 % of sales.  

D. Capital Redeployment  
• 50 % of sale proceeds → 6-month T-bills (risk-free ≈5 %).  
• 30 % → Equal-weighted basket of profitable mega-cap tech (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG) to keep AI/EV exposure with better earnings visibility.  
• 20 % held as tactical cash for a future TSLA re-entry or opportunistic trades.  

E. Monitoring Cadence  
• Review TSLA, BYD, and global EV unit sales each quarter.  
• Track Fed-rate path and EU/US tariff headlines weekly.  
• Re-assess the hedge if the stock moves ±20 % or 60 days before option expiry.  

4.  Lessons Applied From Past Mistakes  
• Avoid “all-or-nothing” stances.  By keeping a core plus an option overlay, we stay exposed to a positive surprise yet protect capital.  
• Force discipline with quantitative guard-rails (margins, technical levels) rather than narratives.  
• Use cheap money-market/T-bill yields as a high bar: if a stock’s risk-adjusted return cannot clearly beat 5 %, step aside.  

Bottom Line  
Current fundamentals and valuation skew the risk-reward sharply to the downside, so we sell/trim now, hedge what remains, and demand visible earnings improvement before committing fresh capital.
