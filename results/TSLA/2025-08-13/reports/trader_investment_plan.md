After careful consideration of the proposed investment plan and weighing the key points presented, the following analysis will guide my trading decision:

The primary bullish points emphasize near-term catalysts like the Full-Self-Driving software release and early Robotaxi trials that could lead to significant future revenue streams. Additionally, Tesla's competitive advantages such as its Supercharger network and established brand provide a strong foundation. The technical indicators also lend support to this view. 

However, the bear points highlight some critical risks. Valuation concerns are at the forefront, with the stock trading at a P/FCF ratio that implies high expectations for flawless execution. Execution risks, based on past delays and dependencies on external chip suppliers, raise alarms about the company's ability to meet projected timelines. Moreover, macroeconomic factors, particularly the potential for stagflation and increasing competition, add uncertainty to future performance.

Considering the arguments presented, despite Tesla's strong brand and innovation potential, the current stock valuation seems excessive given the risks involved. The execution skepticism and macroeconomic headwinds pose significant downside risk, suggesting that the market may be overvaluing future growth.

Based on these insights, it is prudent to reduce exposure to TSLA to mitigate risks, while positioning for potential upside during future re-entries when evidence of progress is clearer.

Therefore, my final recommendation is to act as follows:
