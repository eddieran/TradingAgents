### Current State of the World for Trading and Macroeconomics (Week Ending July 13, 2025)

#### Macroeconomic Developments

1. **U.S. Trade Policies and Tariffs**: 
   - On July 8, 2025, President Donald Trump announced significant tariff increases targeted at 14 countries, including key partners like Japan and South Korea, with implementation set for August 1. This escalation in trade tensions is likely to create ripple effects in global markets, increasing volatility around traded commodities and shares, especially in sectors reliant on international supply chains.
   - Additionally, the originally scheduled "Liberation Day 2.0" tariffs have been postponed until August 1, which may provide temporary relief to affected markets but keeps the overall trading atmosphere tense. 

2. **Market Volatility**:
   - Financial markets are signaling mixed trends; high-risk assets like equities and cryptocurrencies are experiencing upward movement, while traditionally safer investments like government bonds and gold are showing increased demand. Gold prices are reported to have risen sharply, exceeding $3,300 per ounce, as investors shift towards safe-haven assets amidst rising uncertainties in trade policies.

3. **International Trade Negotiations**:
   - The ambitious target of concluding "90 deals in 90 days" has seen limited success, with only two agreements finalized at the time of reporting. This delay in trade negotiations continues to feed uncertainty in the marketplace, impacting market confidence overall.

4. **Global Economic Events**:
   - The 17th BRICS Summit that occurred from July 6-7 focused on sustainable development among its member states. Notably, Chinese Premier Xi Jinping's absence may indicate potential shifts in geopolitical alliances or priorities.

5. **Interest Rates**:
   - The Reserve Bank of Australia's upcoming interest rate decision is significant for global markets, as shifts in Australia's monetary policy could influence currency exchange rates and investor attitudes towards risk.

#### Tesla (TSLA) Market Overview

1. **Stock Performance**:
   - Tesla shares (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropped approximately 7% on July 7 following Elon Musk's announcement to launch a new political party called the "America Party." This move has rekindled investor concerns over Musk's focus and leadership.

2. **Investor Sentiment**:
   - Analysts are expressing doubts about Tesla's trajectory. Concerns regarding declining sales, particularly in China, weight on the stock, with expectations that upcoming earnings (scheduled for July 23) will reflect these struggles. Several analysts have downgraded their ratings or expressed cautious views on TSLA’s outlook.

3. **Political Implications**:
   - The formation of Musk's political party raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, distracting from strategic corporate initiatives. This is leading to a grassroots sense of "exhaustion" among investors as they grapple with the implications these political forays could have on the company’s performance.

4. **Upcoming Events**:
   - Tesla's first showroom in India is set to open on July 15, a potentially significant market entry that could provide a long-term growth avenue if it resonates well with local consumers.
