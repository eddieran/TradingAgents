Based on the detailed analysis presented regarding TSLA, it is clear that the current market conditions and fundamentals are deteriorating for the company. 

Key considerations include:
- The significant decline in California registrations, reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and an increase in executive turnover, which all indicate weakening operational performance.
- The crowded competitive environment and pricing pressures in the EV sector further compound the risk factors.
- The high valuation at a triple-digit P/E suggests limited upside potential and increased risk of downside correction.

Despite Tesla's strong brand recognition and innovative prospects like the Robotaxi and AI software, the evidence supporting the bearish case outweighs the optimism of future optionality. Therefore, it is prudent to act on the immediate concerns rather than speculative future potential.

As for the proposed investment strategy, the recommendation aligns well:
- Selling one-third of the position immediately allows for some capital to be freed up while still retaining a smaller position to monitor future developments.
- Implementing a protective collar strategy is wise to hedge against further downside while maintaining some exposure to potential recovery.

Given the clear evidence of a downturn and the lessons learned from prior positions where holding led to losses, I firmly recommend that it is time to act decisively.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
