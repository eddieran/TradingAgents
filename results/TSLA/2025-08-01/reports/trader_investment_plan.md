Based on the comprehensive analysis provided and the current market sentiment surrounding TSLA, itâ€™s clear that the arguments presented by the bears outweigh the bullish outlook. The deterioration of fundamentals, increased competition, and mounting macroeconomic pressures create a significant risk for the stock, which is currently trading at a high multiple despite falling revenues and margins.

The proposed investment plan outlines a disciplined exit strategy. Given the evidence presented, the recommendation to liquidate 50% of the position and to hedge the remaining exposure is prudent. The consideration for reallocating capital into better-valued clean energy opportunities also aligns well with market trends and risk management strategies.

In conclusion, the stock market can be volatile, especially for companies like Tesla, whose valuation is heavily dependent on future growth. It is wise to act on the current trend rather than holding out for potential future gains that are currently uncertain.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
