Here’s how I see it after weighing the two cases.

What the bulls got right  
• Massive secular tailwind: EV penetration still has a long runway and Tesla owns the mind-share.  
• Balance-sheet flexibility: more than 20 billion in cash, almost no net debt, so bankruptcy risk is low.  
• Optionality: FSD/Robotaxi could be game-changing if it works and clears regulators.  

What the bears got right (and, in my view, carry more weight right now)  
• Valuation is stretched: at ~100× trailing earnings and >60× 2025 consensus EPS, the stock already prices in years of flawless execution. If growth slows even modestly, the multiple compresses hard.  
• Negative free-cash-flow trend: –0.7 % sounds small, but after four price-cut cycles Tesla now spends more cash than it generates, exactly when cap-ex should be paying off.  
• Competitive heat: BYD is already outselling Tesla in China; VW, GM, and Ford are no longer on the sidelines. Share loss in Europe is an early warning.  
• Execution and regulatory risk around FSD/Robotaxi: timelines keep slipping and legal overhangs are real. No hard revenue today, yet much of the bull case assumes full success.  
• Macro headwinds: higher rates and a “risk-off” tape pressure expensive, discretionary-purchase names first.

Past-mistake lesson applied  
In earlier calls I gave too much credit to visionary narratives (e.g., WeWork, Nikola) and not enough to cash-flow math and competitive realities. This time I’m letting the numbers and near-term catalysts—not the story—drive the decision.

Recommendation: Sell / Reduce Exposure  

Rationale  
Upside from here depends almost entirely on breakthrough autonomy or a sudden turn in unit margins—both low-probability 12-month events. Downside, on the other hand, is immediate if growth expectations or the macro backdrop falter. Risk-reward is skewed negatively; therefore, I don’t want full exposure.

Strategic actions  

1. Position sizing  
   • If you already own TSLA, trim 50-75 % of the holding this week. Lock in gains while liquidity is high.  
   • For remaining shares, place a stop-loss 15 % below current levels or buy 6-month 180-strike protective puts to guard against an earnings miss.

2. Re-entry plan  
   • Revisit at a forward P/E below 40 × or after verifiable Robotaxi revenue pilots, whichever comes first.  
   • Keep cash freed up in short-term T-bills (5 % yield) so we can redeploy quickly if the valuation resets.

3. Optional alpha idea  
   • For experienced options traders, write 1-month covered calls $20 out-of-the-money on the residual position; implied vol is rich and will juice yield while we wait.

4. Monitoring list  
   • Monthly China and Europe EV share data.  
   • Gross margin ex-credits; if it stabilizes ≥22 %, reassess.  
   • Regulatory milestones on FSD (California DMV, NHTSA).

Bottom line  
Great company, awkward price. I’m not shorting the business model; I’m short the current valuation. Reduce now, protect what you keep, and be ready to buy back—but only when the numbers, not just the narrative, improve.
