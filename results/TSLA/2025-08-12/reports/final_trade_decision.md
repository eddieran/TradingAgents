FINAL RULING: SELL / REDUCE TO A 1 % “TRADING-STUB”  

================================================================
1.  Key arguments distilled
----------------------------------------------------------------
RISKY (Buy) – “High-multiple companies are often the winners in paradigm shifts.”  
•  EV demand still compounding ~20 % CAGR through 2028.  
•  Vertical integration + AI/FSD + Texas robotaxi licence give Tesla optionality.  
•  10-EMA above 50-SMA, positive MACD = near-term upside momentum.

SAFE/CONSERVATIVE (Sell) – “The market is paying for perfection that is already slipping.”  
•  New-car registrations ‑55 % YoY in core EU markets; BYD and VW are gaining share now.  
•  P/E >140 and β>2 in a capital-intensive industry = asymmetric downside.  
•  Regulatory, legal and brand headwinds are escalating (robotaxi lawsuits, protests).  
•  Dojo pause signals strategy wobble and fresh cap-ex still ahead.

NEUTRAL (Risk-balance) – “Opportunities exist, but only if risk is tightly controlled.”  
•  High multiple makes even small delivery misses painful.  
•  Short-term technical strength is countered by RSI near over-bought and high ATR.  
•  A staggered, stop-loss approach could harvest upside while capping loss.

================================================================
2.  Why SELL wins
----------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Valuation math is uncompelling  
   •  Even if EPS doubles in three years, the stock still trades north of 70×—twice the
     growth-index average.  
   •  “History is littered with high-multiple darlings that rewound 50 – 70 % once unit
     growth slowed” (Safe Analyst).

B.  Evidence of competitive bite is here—not theoretical  
   •  The 55 % registration drop in Europe is a hard data-point, not an analyst model.  
   •  “Market is growing” (Risky) is irrelevant if Tesla’s slice shrinks; operating
     leverage cuts both ways.

C.  Catalysts the market already priced-in remain murky  
   •  Robotaxi revenue is still gated by regulation; Dojo pause questions timetable.  
   •  Investors aren’t being paid to wait given the current multiple.

D.  Technical tail-winds are tactical, not strategic  
   •  With β>2, positive MACD can reverse violently on any macro or company-specific
     headline.  
   •  A strategic call needs a 6-12-month lens (your own criterion #4).

E.  Lesson from past mistakes  
   •  Prior episodes of “story-stocks at triple-digit P/Es” that we held too long cost
     us real money.  Discipline means acting before the draw-down, not after.

================================================================
3.  Refined execution plan (builds on the trader’s draft)
----------------------------------------------------------------
POSITION SIZING  
•  Cap total TSLA exposure at 1 % of equity AUM strictly for tactical trading only.  
•  Treat all remaining shares as option-collateral, not a core investment.

EXIT PATH  
1.  Immediate sale of 60 % of existing shares at next market open  
    – Raises cash and immunises majority of capital from a valuation-compression shock.  
2.  Install a 4 % trailing stop on the residual 40 % (tighter than the earlier 5 % given
   the heightened ATR).  

OPTION HEDGE  
•  Buy 3-month 0.25-delta puts financed by selling 45-day covered calls one standard
  deviation OTM.  Net cash-neutral; preserves modest upside but floors downside.

RE-ENTRY TRIGGERS (MUST hit at least two)  
   a) P/E <60 OR EV/EBITDA ≤7.  
   b) Auto gross margin ex-credits stabilises ≥22 % for two consecutive quarters.  
   c) Global deliveries re-accelerate to ≥25 % YoY.  
   d) Commercial robotaxi approval in two U.S. states OR one major EU jurisdiction
      with identifiable revenue.

MONITOR   (quarterly review)  
•  Europe & China unit volumes vs. peers  
•  Regulatory/legal docket on autonomy and emissions credits  
•  Cap-ex run-rate relative to FCF  
•  Product/strategy clarity on Dojo, Energy, and next-gen vehicle roll-out

TAX & LIQUIDITY NOTE  
•  Use highest-cost-basis lots for the immediate sale to minimise realised gain.  
•  All trades to be executed via VWAP algorithm to mitigate intraday slippage given
  TSLA’s wide bid-ask in fast tape.

================================================================
4.  Bottom line
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tesla remains a pioneering company, but the stock’s risk-reward profile at 140×
earnings in the face of real share-loss, tighter regulation and an untested autonomy
timeline is unfavourable.  Capital preservation—and the flexibility to re-enter at
saner levels—is the superior strategy.

Recommendation: SELL / REDUCE to a 1 % tactical stub, hedge while you wait, and only
rebuild if valuation and execution metrics materially improve.
