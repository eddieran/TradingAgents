Let’s put the debate on the table, strip it to its essentials, and then make a call.

What the bulls said – strongest points  
•  The secular tail-wind: EV demand is expected to grow ~20 % CAGR through 2028, and Tesla still enjoys first-mover brand status.  
•  Technology & vertical integration: Gigafactories, battery chemistry, AI/FSD work, newly licensed robotaxi service in Texas – all potential multi-year growth engines.  
•  Near-term technicals: Rising 10-EMA/50-SMA, positive MACD, heavy trading volume all point to short-term upside momentum.  

What the bears said – strongest points  
•  Market share erosion is real: July new-car registrations in key European markets down >55 % YoY, while BYD, VW, and others are accelerating.  
•  Valuation risk: P/E 148+, beta >2.0. At that multiple, the market is pricing perfection; any stumble can cut the stock in half.  
•  Brand & regulatory headwinds: “Tesla Takedown” protests, consumer backlash, and still-uncertain robotaxi regulation.  
•  Strategy wobble: Dojo super-computer reportedly shelved, hinting at an expensive pivot away from fully in-house AI.  

How I weigh it  
1.  A triple-digit P/E in a capital-intensive industry facing fierce, cash-rich competitors is a red flag I’ve ignored in the past—and paid for.  
2.  Deteriorating European volumes show the competition is biting now, not five years from now.  
3.  Upside catalysts (robotaxi, energy storage) are large, but the timeline is hazy and highly regulated. The market is already paying for them today.  
4.  Short-term bullish technicals are nice for traders, but portfolio decisions need a 6-12-month lens at minimum.  

Decision  
I side with the bear analyst: SELL/UNDERWEIGHT. The risk-reward skew is unfavorable at current levels.

Investment plan for the trader  

1.  Recommendation – Sell / Reduce Position  
   • Trim any TSLA exposure to no more than a tactical 1 % of equity AUM (down from whatever current weighting is).  
   • Treat remaining shares, if any, as a trading stub to write calls against, not a core long.  

2.  Rationale  
   • Valuation extreme: >140× earnings is twice the S&P Growth cohort and 4-5× legacy auto peers that now have credible EV line-ups.  
   • Evidence of demand softening where subsidies have been dialed back (Europe) suggests elasticity is higher than the bull case admits.  
   • Regulatory/political risk around autonomy and CEO behaviour introduces headline shocks that a high-beta name cannot shrug off easily.  
   • We have previously clung to high-multiple “story stocks” hoping for ‘the next catalyst’; that mistake, and the drawdowns that followed, inform this sell call.  

3.  Strategic actions  
   a.  Exit Path  
       • Liquidate 50 % of the position immediately (next open) to lock in current prices.  
       • Place a 5 % trailing stop on the remaining shares to capture any late-cycle momentum pop, automatically exiting into weakness.  
   b.  Hedge While You Wait  
       • Buy three-month 0.30-delta puts financed by selling covered calls one standard-deviation OTM on the residual shares. Net outlay close to zero, caps upside but protects against a slide.  
   c.  Re-entry Discipline  
       • Re-evaluate if one or more of these conditions occur:  
         – P/E compresses below 60 OR shares trade under 7× EV/EBITDA;  
         – Year-on-year global deliveries re-accelerate above 25 %;  
         – Robotaxi/FSD receives clear commercial approval in two major U.S. states or one EU jurisdiction.  
   d.  Monitor  
       • Quarterly margin trend (auto gross margin ex-credits), Europe/China unit sales, capex burn vs. FCF, and any renewed Dojo/FSD roadmap clarity.  

Takeaway  
Tesla is a remarkable company, but the stock is priced for flawless execution in a suddenly very crowded arena. Our job is to earn risk-adjusted returns, not to own every great story. At today’s valuation, the math—and recent demand data—say step aside, bank profits, and revisit when the odds improve.
