1. **US Inflation and Federal Reserve Outlook**:
   - Recent data released on August 13 indicated that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.7% year-on-year for July, slightly below the anticipated figures. This has driven strong market sentiment that the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates in September, with a pricing probability around 94%. It has contributed to a broad rally in US equity markets, including record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

3. **US-China Trade Relations**:
   - President Trump announced a 90-day cessation of tariffs on Chinese imports as of August 13. This announcement has significantly eased trade tensions, fostering a favorable market environment.

4. **India's Economic Dilemma**:
   - India's economy is facing severe challenges, primarily triggered by high US tariffs on Indian exports, pushing the nation to rethink its defense purchase strategies and potentially aligning more with other global powers like Brazil, Russia, and China.

5. **Key Indicators Due**:
   - Upcoming releases include preliminary Q2 GDP figures for the UK and Eurozone, as well as China's industrial production and retail sales data scheduled for August 15. These figures are considered vital for gauging the health of global economies.
